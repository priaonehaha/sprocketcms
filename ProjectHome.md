# SprocketCMS #
_An Advanced Content Management System for ASP.Net 2.0_

## IMPORTANT ##
| The source code here, whilst freely available to do with as you wish, has been advanced an order of magnitude beyond what you'll be able to download here. Sprocket has become [Content Canvas](http://www.contentcanvas.com) a commercial CMS aimed at solving world hunger, curing cancer and cooking perfect toast. Not too expensive and definitely worth checking out. |

## About Sprocket ##
Sprocket is designed to be flexible in a way that other .Net-based CMS's are not. Forget "skinnable" and "themes". Sprocket gives you 100% control over the look and feel of the website you're developing by separating all UI into a clean and powerful templating system that exposes a useful embeddable scripting language to give you the control you need. Even the admin system is put together using the same system as you would use to build the front-end website, so changing the way it looks and behaves is a piece of cake.

Sprocket has also been built with a distaste for the standard ASP.Net WebForms framework. Rather than wallowing around in a hideous mess of ASPX and ASCX files, Sprocket completely discards any requirement for such things. That's right, no viewstate, no javascript postbacks, and an extensibility model that is ACTUALLY easy for developers.

| ~~**CURRENT STATUS**: SprocketCMS release 0.4 is more of a framework than a pure CMS, as the UI for creating pages and content is still in development. A full page editing UI and framework will be available in release 0.5. See CurrentStatusRoadMap for more information.~~ |

### Features ###

  * Advanced, highly flexible pages and templates model that uses friendly URLs. Easier to use than ASP.Net 2.0's master template system.
  * Simple but powerful scripting language (SprocketScript) which can be used in your templates and content to get the most out of your website.
  * Easy to extend. No, really. A bazillion events and hooks you can use to interrupt the flow wherever you want. Want to make your own module? Implement an interface that has just one method. Use that interface to hook any events that are relevant to you. Sprocket will find the module and do the rest.
  * Advanced AJAX framework. Sprocket translates methods and classes you specify directly into callable javascript objects and methods. All the data transfer and JSON encoding/decoding is done for you (unless you _really_ want to do it).
  * Full security model [optional!] that supports users, roles, role inheritance and permissions that can be attached to users and/or roles.
  * Multi-tier database management framework to allow you to use whichever database you want. Sprocket is designed to make it as painless as possible to support new databases if desired, and to extend existing modules to support your database of choice.
